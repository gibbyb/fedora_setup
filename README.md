# Fedora Setup Script
This is my personal Fedora setup script. Due to being an NVIDIA user (for now), I sometimes encounter OS breaking updates, and rather than allow myself to get frustrated with an operating system I absolutely love because of a billion dollar company that I don't, I decided to do everything I can to make reinstalling and reconfiguring my operating system as easy as possible. This also allows me to get up and running with my favorite applications on any system very quickly.

I would not recommend anyone else run this, as a lot of things in here are specific to me, but of course you are free to use the code however you would like, and it may help you at least get started on automating your own setup script. This is something I will of course be working on indefinitely, and will only get better, but as it currently is, this script will probably save me at least an hour of configuring.
