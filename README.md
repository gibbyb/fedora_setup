# Fedora Setup Script
This is my personal setup script for Fedora. I am still working on it and adding to it, and have not yet been able to test it so 
I would not reccomend using it on a machine on bare metal unless you have a backup or snapshot beforehand. I am currently
only uploading it to github so I can test it in a vm where I clone the github and see how well the script actually works.
